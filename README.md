# RPG CHARACTER SHEET API

## Description

Project is a POC for no-framework lightweight API written in clear NodeJS with Typescript. The idea is to stray away from external libraries as much as possible with emphasis on clean architecture.

## Setting up project locally

- Prepare a `.env` file based on `.env.example` file in main project directory,
- Type `docker compose up --build` in terminal to build and run a project preparing endpoints on port 3000

## Disclaimers

- Project has a strictly educational purpose, not to be used in production - some secrets might be visible in the code.
